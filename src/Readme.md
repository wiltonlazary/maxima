The source folder
-----------------

This folder contains all the source files for maxima except of the 
share packages.

The things to note here are:

 * Maxima isn't built by make directly.
   Instead make triggers a lisp-only build using defsystem a make-like
   program whose advantage is that it even works on machines that
   (besides a lisp) don't have any specialized tools installed.
   The "Makefile" that controls the build of maxima is named
   `maxima.system`.

 * `share-subdirs.lisp` is auto-generated by make, but included in the
   repo, as well, in order to make it available to the lisp-only build.
