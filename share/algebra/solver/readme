This package is solver, a parametric equation solver, written by
Eckhard Hennig and Ralf Sommer.  I have made some minor modifications
to it so that it runs on maxima. 
I wish to thank Dr. Hennig for his donation of the solver code to the
maxima project.

I decided to try to retranslate the original German document solver1.pdf hoping that advances in machine translation would improve it, however the translation
still needed editing. 
Dr. Wolfgang Lindner reviewed the document and was able to get the original tex
source from Dr. Hennig. He was also able to update the diagrams. I then made
some minor changes to the English grammar and wording.

I also want to thank Dr. Dorai Sitaram for help debugging my Tex environment.

NB The file solver-diagramms.docx is only editable using TextMaker and one of
the images is only partially editable.
It appears that the variable described in the document SolverAssumptions is
Solver_Assumptions.
